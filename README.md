# Fake-News-Detection-using-LSTM
The "Fake News Detection using LSTM" project aims to develop an advanced and efficient solution to combat the spread of misinformation in digital media. Leveraging the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN), this project intends to create a robust system for automatically identifying and categorizing fake news articles.

The project will involve several key steps. Firstly, a comprehensive dataset comprising both real and fake news articles will be curated and preprocessed. The LSTM model will then be designed and trained on this dataset to learn intricate patterns and dependencies in text data. By capturing temporal relationships and context, the LSTM will gain the ability to distinguish subtle linguistic cues that often differentiate authentic news from fabricated content.
